# Java-Programming-Assignment-Repository
This repository contains the source code for my COP 3330 class
This repository contains a collection of Java exercises and projects that demonstrate fundamental concepts of Java programming.

## Projects Included:

* **PasswordApp:**  This program validates usernames and passwords based on custom rules, using custom exceptions to handle invalid input.
* **Division:** This program takes two integers as input and performs division, handling the `ArithmeticException` that occurs when dividing by zero.
* **UltimateBattleApp:** This program introduces the concepts of Threads & Concurrency.
* **Water:** This program introduces the concepts of Threads & Concurrency.
* **Arbys:** This program demonstrates the usage of classes and objects in Java.
* **BurgerKing:** This program demonstrates the usage of classes and objects in Java.
* **Contender:** This program is used by UltimateBattleApp to pull contender information.

## Technologies Used:

* Java 17 (or whichever version you used)

## How to Run:

(Provide specific instructions for compiling and running each program.  For example:)

**PasswordApp:**

1. Compile: `javac PasswordApp.java`
2. Run: `java PasswordApp`

**Division:**

1. Compile: `javac Division.java`
2. Run: `java Division`

**UltimateBattleApp:**

1. Compile: `javac UltimateBattleApp.java`
2. Run: `java UltimateBattleApp`

**Water:**

1. Compile: `javac Water.java`
2. Run: `java Water`

**Arbys:**

1. Compile: `javac Arbys.java`
2. Run: `java Arbys`

**BurgerKing:**

1. Compile: `javac BurgerKing.java`
2. Run: `java BurgerKing`

## Challenges and Lessons Learned:

* **PasswordApp:**  I learned how to create and handle custom exceptions.
* **Division:** I learned how to handle built-in exceptions like `ArithmeticException`.
* **UltimateBattleApp:** I learned how to use threads and concurrency in Java.
* **Water:** I learned how to use threads and concurrency in Java.
* **Arbys:** I learned how to create and use classes and objects in Java.
* **BurgerKing:** I learned how to create and use classes and objects in Java.
